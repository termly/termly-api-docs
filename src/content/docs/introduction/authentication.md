description: A guide on how to get your API key and authenticate requests to the Termly API

The Termly API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

The Termly API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Currently, if you want to use the partner API you need to be issued keys manually by us. Please reach out to us here: https://termly.io/agencies/ to get access.
